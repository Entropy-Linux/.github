# Entropy Linux
> Entropy Linux is a cutting-edge operating system, derived from MX23-Minimal, designed with a sharp focus on delivering a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing user experience. It adopts a sleek, global dark theme that not only pleases the eye but also enhances usability, especially in low-light conditions. At the core of its development ethos is the full integration of AMD™️ Radeon ROCm support, making it a go-to choice for users requiring robust computational performance, particularly in graphics and computing tasks.
Developed by Szmelc.INC, Entropy Linux serves as a prototype platform for showcasing our original software innovations. Our vision extends beyond the present, aiming to gradually evolve Entropy Linux into a fully independent ecosystem. This ambitious goal involves forking and developing our own suite of utilities and software, thereby crafting a unique, stable, and lightweight operating system tailored to the needs of our users.
