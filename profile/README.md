# Entropy Linux
> Entropy Linux, based on MX23-Minimal, is strange, slightly buggy OS with built-in szmelc and Extensive AMD hardware support. \
It rocks a global dark theme with unique szmelc aesthetics and style.  \
Be ready for some unique surprises as it doesn't always play nice. \
Created by Szmelc.INC, it's more of a proving grounds for our software than a polished product. \
We're ambitiously trying to build a whole new ecosystem around it, so expect ongoing changes and some DIY on your part.
