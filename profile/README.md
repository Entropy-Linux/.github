# Entropy Linux
> Entropy Linux, based on MX23-Minimal, is our quirky, slightly buggy OS with built-in quirks and features. It rocks a dark themeâ€”easy on the eyes, especially in dim lighting. While it's meant to support AMD Radeon ROCm, be ready for some unique surprises as it doesn't always play nice. Created by Szmelc.INC, it's more of a testing ground for our software ideas than a polished product. We're ambitiously trying to build a whole new software ecosystem around it, so expect ongoing changes and some DIY on your part.
