### WARNING! ~ *All new releases (.iso) will be hosted on sourceforge.net due to GitHub limiting file size to 2GB*

> Entropy Linux, based on MX-Minimal, \
is strange and slightly buggy OS with dedicated software (szmelc) and extensive AMD™ hardware support. \
It features a global dark theme with pleasing aesthetics and style. \
Created by single head dev and his friends, \
Entropy promotes an anti-corporate mindset and a strong belief in free and open source. 

> More of an experimental proving ground than a polished product, \
Entropy is part of an actively developed ecosystem aiming for seamless integration of all things szmelc (and beyond!). \
Expect ongoing changes and some DIY on your part. \
Be prepared for unique surprises, as it doesn't always play nice. 

> Discover its unique additions, useful recommendations, many quality-of-life changes, and a few wholesome easter eggs. \
Some of its best features include OCR to clipboard, ROCm Installer, integrated temporary file hosting, preloaded AdBlockers, and more!
