> ***Based on MX-Minimal. Built for experimentation and everyday use.***
Entropy is an experimental system for people who like to tinker.
It’s optimized for AMD™ hardware, has a global dark theme, and includes practical built-in tools.
Made by one developer and a few friends, it’s not polished,
it’s a system for learning, experimenting, and making things work.

> ***Why Entropy?***
Easy to Use, Built to Explore: Great for Linux newcomers and experienced users alike.
Custom Tools: Practical software to save time and simplify tasks.
AMD™ Optimized: Designed to run smoothly on AMD hardware.
Part of a Bigger Idea: A piece of the growing ecosystem, tying projects together.
Entropy is a work in progress with regular updates and plenty of room for experimentation. It might need some tweaking to fit your flow, but that’s part of the fun.

> ***What to Expect?*** \
A practical, solid distro with unique features and lots of room to grow.
