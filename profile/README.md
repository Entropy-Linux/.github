#### ***Based on MX-Minimal. Built for experimentation and everyday use.*** 
> Entropy is an experimental system for people who like to tinker. \
It’s optimized for AMD™ hardware, has a global dark theme, and includes practical built-in tools.\
Made by one developer and a few friends, it’s not polished,\
it’s a system for learning, experimenting, and making things work.

#### ***Why Entropy?***
> Easy to Use, Built to Explore: Great for Linux newcomers and experienced users alike.\
Custom Tools: Practical software to save time and simplify tasks.\
AMD™ Optimized: Designed to run smoothly on AMD hardware.\
Part of a Bigger Idea: A piece of the growing ecosystem, tying projects together.\
Entropy is a work in progress with regular updates and plenty of room for experimentation. \
It might need some tweaking to fit your flow, but that’s part of the fun.

#### ***What to Expect?*** 
> A practical, solid distro with unique features and lots of room to grow. \
> Maybe few minor bugs, 'work in progress' features, and some cool easter eggs!
